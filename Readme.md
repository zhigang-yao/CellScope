# CellScope

CellScope is an innovative framework designed for constructing high-resolution, multi-scale cell atlases. It provides detailed information about gene expression, molecular characteristics, and functional states of individual cells, enabling researchers to understand cellular heterogeneity, development, and function in unprecedented detail. Traditional methods for developing comprehensive cell atlases often face challenges, such as reliance on conventional unsupervised learning algorithms and difficulties in identifying rare cell populations. CellScope addresses these limitations by employing a refined gene selection strategy, utilizing manifold fitting for cell clustering, and introducing a tree-structured visualization to represent cellular hierarchy intuitively.

## Workflow Overview (**Figure c**)

1. **Manifold Assumption**
    - CellScope assumes that true biological structures in single-cell data lie on a **low-dimensional manifold** that captures cellular states and subtypes.
    - However, observed gene expression is affected by two types of noise (**Figure a**):
        - **Housekeeping gene noise** (ubiquitous genes that do not distinguish cell types).
        - **Technical noise** (mRNA loss, inefficient capture, sequencing errors).

2. **Two-Step Manifold Fitting (**Figure b**)**
    - **Step 1: Noise Mitigation**
        - Separates **signal space** (informative genes) from **noise space** (housekeeping genes).
        - Identifies **manifold seeds** and **highly reliable cliques** to filter out irrelevant variation.
    - **Step 2: Cell-Type Stratification**
        - Assigns low-density cells (transitional states, noisy profiles) to the nearest **cell-type submanifold**.
        - Enhances biological signal while reducing artifacts.

3. **Neighborhood Graph & Clustering**
    - Constructs a **cell-to-cell similarity graph** based on gene expression.
    - Performs **agglomerative clustering** to define biologically meaningful cell types.

4. **Tree-Structured Visualization**
    - Integrates **UMAP** for intuitive low-dimensional visualization.
    - Generates a **hierarchical tree** to depict relationships between cell types.
    - Annotates key regulatory genes driving cell fate decisions (**Figure d**).
